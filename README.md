# EPIC-Annotated-epileptic-EEG-independent-components-for-artifact-reduction

Scripts used to create the dataset described in EPIC: Annotated epileptic EEG independent components for artifact reduction.

All the scripts as well as the datasets are available at https://zenodo.org/record/6620655.

It is worth noting that these scripts also comprise the pipeline to automatically preprocess EEG signals

Use main.m to preprocess the EEG signals. You must have EEGLAB folder in the same directory. The code was developed using EEGLAB 2019.

In the case you use these scripts, cite one of the following manuscripts:
